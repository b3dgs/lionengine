/**
 * Represents something that can have a collection of {@link Feature}.
 * <p>
 * Such a system allows to reduce direct complexity by splitting object implementation into different classes. Each will
 * provide a specific sub system, called a {@link Feature}. They will compose a complex system, called a
 * {@link Featurable}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Problematic</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation of an object, which may move and can collide other objects which may not all move.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Naive solution</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One big object, implementing moving and colliding.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Feature solution</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sub system implementation, sub system composition:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Localization feature: <i>Simple representation of something which have a coordinate</i></li>
 * <li>Moving feature: <i>System dedicated to handle the movement of something</i></li>
 * <li>Colliding feature: <i>System dedicated to collision representation and detection</i></li>
 * <li>Little object: <i>Supporting moving and colliding feature independently</i></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This way, our object is now very simple, as it only declares its required features. Implementations are localized in
 * specific classes, which helps to avoid <i>god class</i> if our object want to also jump and throw something.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Caution</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The counterpart of such a system is the low typing of our final object, as it is only known at runtime, even if they
 * are statically declared. An object is just a set of <i>something</i>, which can lead to undesired exceptions if not
 * used correctly. Documentation must explicit the required {@link Feature}, in order to use an object properly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An alternative could be direct {@link Feature} implementation, combined with simple delegate.
 * </p>
