/**
 * States are designed to implement easily a gameplay by reducing implementation complexity.
 * <p>
 * In other word, gameplay can be represented as a finite state machine. This will ensure gameplay state validity,
 * instead of checking tons of boolean to catch the right state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The only counter part is the number of class, which is usually one class per state. So typically, for a simple
 * gameplay (<code>Idle, Walk, Jump</code>), it will need 3 state classes, plus the {@link StateHandler}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage is quite simple:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #enter()} one time on the state (reset default state and prepare for update)</li>
 * <li>{@link #update(double)} the state for each game loop</li>
 * <li>The {@link StateHandler} will allow to choose which state should be then returned if needed, and {@link #enter()}
 * will be called, and so on</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @see StateHandler
